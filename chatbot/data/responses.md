## What is a novel coronavirus?
* FAQ/ask_corona_1
- <p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p><p>A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.</p>

## Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_2
- <p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1227297754499764230">announced</a> an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">many types</a> of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="tp-link-policy tp-link-policy" data-domain-ext="int" href="https://www.who.int/topics/infectious_diseases/naming-new-diseases/en/">best practice<span class="sr-only">external icon</span><span class="sr-only">external icon</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external"></span></a> for naming of new human infectious diseases.</p>

## Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_3
- <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.</p> <p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p> <p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.</p>

## How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_4
- <p>People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/reducing-stigma.html">mental health</a> of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/coping.html">resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19</a>. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html">knowing the facts</a> and sharing them with others in your community.</p>

## Why do some state’s COVID-19 case numbers sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website?
* FAQ/ask_corona_5
- <p>CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.</p>

##How do CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers compare with those provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Johns Hopkins?
* FAQ/ask_corona_6
- <p>CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.</p>

## Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?
* FAQ/ask_corona_7
- <p>Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.</p>

## What is the source of the virus?
* FAQ/ask_corona_8
- <p>COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html">MERS-CoV</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html">SARS-CoV</a>, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#emergence">Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus</a>.</p>

##How does the virus spread?
* FAQ/ask_corona_9
- <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p><p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">many affected geographic areas</a>. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p><p>Learn what is known about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html">spread of newly emerged coronaviruses</a>.</p>

## Why are we seeing a rise in cases?
* FAQ/ask_corona_10
- <p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">number of cases of COVID-19</a> being reported in the United States is rising due to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html">increased laboratory testing</a> and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.</p>

## Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?
* FAQ/ask_corona_11
- <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">spreading from person-to-person</a>. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.</p><p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html">CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation</a> and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19</a>.</p><p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.</p>

## Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?
* FAQ/ask_corona_12
- <p>Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.</p>

## Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?
* FAQ/ask_corona_13
- <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p><p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.</p><p>Learn what is known about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html">spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

## Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?
* FAQ/ask_corona_14
- <p>Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.</p>

## Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_15
- <p>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p>

## What is community spread?
* FAQ/ask_corona_16
- <p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>

## What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_17
- <p>Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-your-home.html">CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection</a>.</p>

## Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_18
- <p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">How Coronavirus Spreads</a> for more information.</p>

## Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?

## Does CDC recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19?
* FAQ/ask_corona_23
- <p>In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">cloth face covering</a> to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p>

## Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?
* FAQ/ask_corona_24
- <p>There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. This coronaviruses is thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website</a> as it becomes available.</p>

## Is it okay for me to donate blood?
* FAQ/ask_corona_25
- <p>In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.</p>

## Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?
* FAQ/ask_corona_30
- <p>No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.</p>


## Should children wear masks?
* FAQ/ask_corona_31
- <p>CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.</p><p>Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p>

## How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?
* FAQ/ask_corona_32
- <p>Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html">Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults</a>.

## What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?
* FAQ/ask_corona_33
- <p>This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.</p> <p>If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.</p> <p>Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.</p>
